# Time Off Managemnet App

This is a Microsoft Dynamics CRM Power Apps Canvas application in which a user can register for an account and request time off from their assigned manager. The request includes relevant information such as time off reason category, start and end dates, and available time. User time is accrued incrementally at different rates for different departments. Manager-Administrators are automatically alerted by email of the request by their subordinates and have the ability to log in and approve or reject the request along with a message. All data is stored on the backend with an integrated SharePoint database.
